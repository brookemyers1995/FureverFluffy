    			<h2>About Furever Fluffy</h2>
        		<p>Furever Fluffy was founded by Brooke Myers, a passionate animal lover with a vision to 
        		create a grooming salon that feels like a second home for pets. With a background in 
        		professional grooming and years of experience in pet care, Brooke set out to build a place
        		 where grooming is not just a service, but an experience that both pets and their owners look forward to. 
        		 Starting as a small, single-room operation, Furever Fluffy has grown into a full-service grooming salon, 
        		 thanks to our loyal customers and their word-of-mouth recommendations. Over the years, we’ve expanded our 
        		 services to include specialized grooming for all breeds, skin and coat treatments, and even spa packages 
        		 to indulge your pets. Our team of professional groomers is the heart and soul of Furever Fluffy. Each member brings unique skills

        		and specializes in breed-specific cuts and creative grooming. Jessica, our lead groomer from Austin, Texas, 
        		has over 10 years of experience and is known for her gentle touch and 
        		exceptional skill with scissors. Maya, a certified pet stylist, has been with Furever Fluffy since 2020 and is renowned for her 
        		meticulous attention to detail and artistic flair.</p>
