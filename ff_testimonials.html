            		<p>"Hello, I really recommend this place. Today I took my goldendoodle and the experience was spectacular. 
            		The girl was very attentive and very kind to both of us. Throughout the process she kept in touch and 
            		gave me updates on everything. I really felt very comfortable with everything and my dog ‚Äã‚Äãturned out beautiful. 
            		When my children saw her they fell in love üòç and were very happy. I give her 200% and I will definitely be back."</br> - Gretchen D.</p><!-- Text content (Customer review) -->

            		<p>"We called to get our Mr. Cuties‚Äôs nails done because another Groomer he has been with for 
            		years is just not reliable. She was kind enough to squeeze him in and treated him like a KING!!!! 
            		He came home so proud after he had been loved on and treated so well. This will now be our new Groomer! 
            		Thank you for your kindness and love you showed him. You can‚Äôt fake that. We truly sooo everything you 
            		did and looking forward to seeing you again! Hugs- Mr Cutie"</br> - Rebecca H.</p><!-- Text content (Customer review) -->
