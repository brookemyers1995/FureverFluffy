            <p>Please note that the groomer has a very busy schedule and time slots fill up fast! The salon is typically booked out a few weeks in advance. 
            Due to the limited time frame for the groomer on staff, we are only accepting 2 dogs a day. 
            Each appointment can take at least 1 1/2 hours. This ensures that your pet has a peaceful experience and receives the best quality. 
            To book an appointment,simply call/text the phone number provided on the site or fill out a contact form located on the contact us section. 
            Thank you for your understanding and we look forward to meeting you and your furry friend(s)!</p> <!-- The paragraph that will be displayed below the h2 heading and above the table -->
